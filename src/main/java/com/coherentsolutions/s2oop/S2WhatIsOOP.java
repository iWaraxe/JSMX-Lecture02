// Section: What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?
// -----------------------------------------------

/*
- OOP is a programming paradigm.
- A 'paradigm' is a model or pattern; it's a way to organize and structure your code.
*/

/*
- Importance of OOP:
  - Scalability: Easier to expand and add functionalities.
  - Maintainability: Makes the code more organized, easier to manage.
  - Reusability: Write once, use multiple times.
*/

/*
- Four Pillars of OOP:
  1. Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods together.
  2. Inheritance: Creating new classes based on existing classes.
  3. Polymorphism: One interface, multiple implementations.
  4. Abstraction: Hiding the complex reality while exposing only the essentials.
